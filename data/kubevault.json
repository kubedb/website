      "description": "When a Vault server is started, it starts in a sealed state. In a sealed state, almost no operation is possible with a Vault server. So, you will need to unseal Vault. Vault operator provides automatic initialization and unsealing facility. When you deploy or scale up a Vault server, you don't have worry about unsealing new Vault pods. Vault operator will do it for you. Also, it provides a secure way to store unseal keys and root token."
