Combined Cluster An Elasticsearch combined cluster is a group of one or more Elasticsearch nodes where each node can perform as master, data, and ingest nodes simultaneously.
Before You Begin At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using kind.</description></item><item><title>Elasticsearch Topology Cluster</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/v2021.03.17/guides/elasticsearch/clustering/topology-cluster/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/v2021.03.17/guides/elasticsearch/clustering/topology-cluster/</guid><description>New to KubeDB?

Topology Cluster An Elasticsearch topology cluster is a group of Elasticsearch nodes ( &amp;gt;= 3 ) where each node is assigned with a dedicated role such as master, data, and ingest. In a topology cluster, there has to be at least one master node, one data node, and one ingest node.
