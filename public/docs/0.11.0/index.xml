Operator &amp;amp; cli version: KubeDB follows semver versioning policy. Until 1.0 release is done, there might be breaking changes between point releases of the operator. Please always check the release notes for upgrade instructions. CRD version: kubedb.com/v1alpha1 is considered in alpha. This means breaking changes to the YAML format might happen among different releases of the operator.</description></item><item><title>Support | KubeDB</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.11.0/welcome/support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.11.0/welcome/support/</guid><description>Support We use Slack for public discussions.
