 Continuous Archiving with WAL-G KubeDB supports continuous archiving of PostgreSQL WAL files using WAL-G . You can use s3, gcs, azure, or swift to store the WAL files.
What is Continuous Archiving
PostgreSQL maintains a write ahead log (WAL) in the pg_xlog/ subdirectory of the cluster&amp;rsquo;s data directory. The existence of the log makes it possible to use a third strategy for backing up databases and if recovery is needed, restore from the backed-up WAL files to bring the system back to last known state.</description>

 Continuous Archiving to Azure WAL-G is used to continuously archive PostgreSQL WAL files. Please refer to continuous archiving in KubeDB to learn more about it.
Before You Begin At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using minikube.</description>

 Database Snapshot KubeDB operator maintains another Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for database backups called Snapshot. Snapshot object is used to take backup or restore from a backup. For more details about Snapshot please visit here.
This tutorial will show how to take instant backup of PostgreSQL database deployed with KubeDB.
Before You Begin At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t know how backup works? Check tutorial on Instant Backup.
 Database Scheduled Snapshots KubeDB supports taking periodic backups for PostgreSQL database.
Before You Begin At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using minikube.
Now, install KubeDB cli on your workstation and KubeDB operator in your cluster following the steps here.</description>
