Continuous Archiving with WAL-G KubeDB supports continuous archiving of PostgreSQL WAL files using WAL-G . You can use s3, gcs, azure, swift, MinIO, or local storage to store the WAL files.
What is Continuous Archiving
PostgreSQL maintains a write ahead log (WAL) in the pg_xlog/ subdirectory of the cluster&amp;rsquo;s data directory. The existence of the log makes it possible to use a third strategy for backing up databases and if recovery is needed, restore from the backed-up WAL files to bring the system back to last known state.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Archiving to Azure</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/v2020.12.10/guides/postgres/backup/wal/archiving_to_azure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/v2020.12.10/guides/postgres/backup/wal/archiving_to_azure/</guid><description>New to KubeDB?
