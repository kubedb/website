You can use builtin Prometheus scraper or CoreOS Prometheus Operator to monitor KubeDB supported databases as well as KubeDB operator itself. This tutorial will show you what metrics KubeDB operator exports and how to enable monitoring for the operator itself.
Overview KubeDB operator pod runs an Extension API Server which self hosts admission webhooks such as MutatingAdmissionWebhook and ValidatingAdmissionWebhook.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring KubeDB Operator Using CoreOS Prometheus Operator</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/v0.13.0-rc.0/setup/monitoring/coreos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/v0.13.0-rc.0/setup/monitoring/coreos/</guid><description>Monitoring KubeDB Operator Using CoreOS Prometheus Operator CoreOS prometheus-operator provides simple and Kubernetes native way to deploy and configure Prometheus server. This tutorial will show you how to use CoreOS Prometheus operator for monitoring KubeDB operator.
Before You Begin At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using Minikube.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring KubeDB Operator with builtin Prometheus</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/v0.13.0-rc.0/setup/monitoring/builtin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/v0.13.0-rc.0/setup/monitoring/builtin/</guid><description>Monitoring KubeDB Operator with builtin Prometheus This tutorial will show you how to configure builtin Prometheus scraper to monitor KubeDB operator.
