Continuous Archiving with wal-g KubeDB PostgreSQL also supports continuous archiving using wal-g . Now wal-g supports S3 and GCP as cloud storage.
Before You Begin At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using minikube.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Archiving of PostgreSQL</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.11.0/guides/postgres/snapshot/continuous_archiving/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.11.0/guides/postgres/snapshot/continuous_archiving/</guid><description>New to KubeDB?

Continuous Archiving with WAL-G KubeDB supports continuous archiving of PostgreSQL WAL files using WAL-G . You can use s3, gcs, azure, or swift to store the WAL files.
What is Continuous Archiving
PostgreSQL maintains a write ahead log (WAL) in the pg_xlog/ subdirectory of the cluster&amp;rsquo;s data directory. The existence of the log makes it possible to use a third strategy for backing up databases and if recovery is needed, restore from the backed-up WAL files to bring the system back to last known state.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Archiving of PostgreSQL</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.12.0/guides/postgres/snapshot/continuous_archiving/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.12.0/guides/postgres/snapshot/continuous_archiving/</guid><description>New to KubeDB?

Running Elasticsearch This tutorial will show you how to use KubeDB to run an Elasticsearch database.
Before You Begin At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using Minikube. Now, install KubeDB cli on your workstation and KubeDB operator in your cluster following the steps here.</description></item><item><title>Elasticsearch</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.8.0-beta.2/concepts/databases/elasticsearch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.8.0-beta.2/concepts/databases/elasticsearch/</guid><description>New to KubeDB?

Running Memcached This tutorial will show you how to use KubeDB to run a Memcached database.
Before You Begin At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using Minikube.
Now, install KubeDB cli on your workstation and KubeDB operator in your cluster following the steps here.</description></item><item><title>Memcached</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.8.0-beta.2/concepts/databases/memcached/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.8.0-beta.2/concepts/databases/memcached/</guid><description>New to KubeDB?

Running MongoDB This tutorial will show you how to use KubeDB to run a MongoDB database.
Before You Begin At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using Minikube.
Now, install KubeDB cli on your workstation and KubeDB operator in your cluster following the steps here.</description></item><item><title>MongoDB</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.8.0-beta.2/concepts/databases/mongodb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.8.0-beta.2/concepts/databases/mongodb/</guid><description>New to KubeDB?

MongoDB Replication A replica set in MongoDB is a group of mongod processes that maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability, and are the basis for all production deployments.

MongoDB Replication A replica set in MongoDB is a group of mongod processes that maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability, and are the basis for all production deployments.

Monitoring KubeDB KubeDB has native support for monitoring via Prometheus.
Monitoring KubeDB Operator KubeDB operator exposes Prometheus native monitoring data via /metrics endpoint on :56790 port. You can setup a CoreOS Prometheus ServiceMonitor using kubedb-operator service. To change the port, use --address flag on KubeDB operator.
Monitoring Databases KubeDB operator can create service monitors for database pods. If enabled, a side-car exporter pod is run with database pods to expose Prometheus ready metrics via the following endpoints on port :56790:</description></item><item><title>Monitoring</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.8.0-beta.0/guides/monitoring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.8.0-beta.0/guides/monitoring/</guid><description>New to KubeDB?

KubeDB - MySQL Group Replication This tutorial will show you how to use KubeDB to provision a MySQL replication group in single-primary mode.
Before You Begin Before proceeding:
Read mysql group replication concept to learn about MySQL Group Replication.

Then, KubeDB will use the docker images specified in the MySQLVersion crd to create your expected database.</description></item><item><title>Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) | Postgres</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.10.0/guides/postgres/initialization/pitr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.10.0/guides/postgres/initialization/pitr/</guid><description>New to KubeDB?

Now, install KubeDB cli on your workstation and KubeDB operator in your cluster following the steps here.</description></item><item><title>PostgreSQL Quickstart</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.8.0/guides/postgres/quickstart/quickstart/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.8.0/guides/postgres/quickstart/quickstart/</guid><description>New to KubeDB?

Running Redis This tutorial will show you how to use KubeDB to run an Redis database.
Before You Begin At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using Minikube.
Now, install KubeDB cli on your workstation and KubeDB operator in your cluster following the steps here.</description></item><item><title>Redis</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.8.0-beta.2/concepts/databases/redis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.8.0-beta.2/concepts/databases/redis/</guid><description>New to KubeDB?

Redis Cluster Redis Cluster provides a way to partition data among multiple master nodes (data sharding) and ensures data availability. Each of the master nodes may have its own replicas. The cluster member nodes (both masters and replicas) detect failures via internal interconnection among themselves.

Now, install KubeDB cli on your workstation and KubeDB operator in your cluster following the steps here.</description></item><item><title>Redis Quickstart</title><link>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.9.0-rc.2/guides/redis/quickstart/quickstart/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubedb.com/docs/0.9.0-rc.2/guides/redis/quickstart/quickstart/</guid><description>New to KubeDB?
