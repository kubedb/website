## kubedb delete

Delete resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector

### Synopsis

Delete resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector. JSON and YAML formats are accepted.

 Note that the delete command does NOT do resource version checks

```
kubedb delete ([-f FILENAME] | TYPE [(NAME | -l label | --all)])
```

### Examples

```
  # Delete a elasticsearch using the type and name specified in elastic.json.
  kubedb delete -f ./elastic.json
  
  # Delete a postgres based on the type and name in the JSON passed into stdin.
  cat postgres.json | kubedb delete -f -
  
  # Delete elasticsearch with label elasticsearch.kubedb.com/name=elasticsearch-demo.
  kubedb delete elasticsearch -l elasticsearch.kubedb.com/name=elasticsearch-demo
  
  # Delete all mysql objects
  kubedb delete mysql --all
```

### Options

```
      --all                     Delete all resources, including uninitialized ones, in the namespace of the specified resource types.
      --cascade                 If true, cascade the deletion of the resources managed by this resource (e.g. Pods created by a ReplicationController).  Default true. (default true)
      --field-selector string   Selector (field query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. --field-selector key1=value1,key2=value2). The server only supports a limited number of field queries per type.
  -f, --filename strings        containing the resource to delete.
      --force                   Only used when grace-period=0. If true, immediately remove resources from API and bypass graceful deletion. Note that immediate deletion of some resources may result in inconsistency or data loss and requires confirmation.
      --grace-period int        Period of time in seconds given to the resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative. Set to 1 for immediate shutdown. Can only be set to 0 when --force is true (force deletion). (default -1)
  -h, --help                    help for delete
      --ignore-not-found        Treat "resource not found" as a successful delete. Defaults to "true" when --all is specified.
      --now                     If true, resources are signaled for immediate shutdown (same as --grace-period=1).
  -o, --output string           Output mode. Use "-o name" for shorter output (resource/name).
  -R, --recursive               Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
  -l, --selector string         Selector (label query) to filter on, not including uninitialized ones.
      --timeout duration        The length of time to wait before giving up on a delete, zero means determine a timeout from the size of the object
      --wait                    If true, wait for resources to be gone before returning. This waits for finalizers. (default true)
```

      --certificate-authority string     Path to a cert file for the certificate authority
      --client-certificate string        Path to a client certificate file for TLS

      --log-backtrace-at traceLocation   when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace (default :0)
      --log-dir string                   If non-empty, write log files in this directory
      --log-flush-frequency duration     Maximum number of seconds between log flushes (default 5s)
      --logtostderr                      log to standard error instead of files
