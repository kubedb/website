# Continuous Archiving with WAL-G

KubeDB supports continuous archiving of PostgreSQL WAL files using [WAL-G ](https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g). You can use `s3`, `gcs`, `azure`, `swift`,  `MinIO`, or  `local` storage to store the WAL files.

**What is Continuous Archiving**

PostgreSQL maintains a write ahead log (WAL) in the `pg_xlog/` subdirectory of the cluster's data directory.  The existence of the log makes it possible to use a third strategy for backing up databases and if recovery is needed, restore from the backed-up WAL files to bring the system back to last known state.

To know more about continuous archiving, please refer to the [ofiicial postgres document](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/continuous-archiving.html) on this topic.

**Continuous Archiving Setup**

Following additional parameters are set in `postgresql.conf` for *primary* server

```console
archive_command = 'wal-g wal-push %p'
archive_timeout = 60
```
