# PostgreSQL Initialization from WAL files

KubeDB supports PostgreSQL database initialization. When you create a new Postgres object, you can provide existing WAL files to restore from by "replaying" the log entries. Users can now restore from any one of `s3`, `gcs`, `azure`, or `swift` as cloud backup provider.

**What is Continuous Archiving**

PostgreSQL maintains a write ahead log (WAL) in the `pg_xlog/` subdirectory of the cluster's data directory.  The existence of the log makes it possible to restore from the backed-up WAL files to bring the system back to a last known state.

To know more about continuous archiving, please refer to the [ofiicial postgres document](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/continuous-archiving.html) on this topic.
