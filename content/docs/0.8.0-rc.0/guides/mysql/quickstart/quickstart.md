</p>

The yaml files that are used in this tutorial, stored in [docs/examples](https://github.com/kubedb/cli/tree/master/docs/examples) folder in GitHub repository [kubedb/cli](https://github.com/kubedb/cli).

## Before You Begin

At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube).

Now, install KubeDB cli on your workstation and KubeDB operator in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/0.8.0-rc.0/setup/install).

To keep things isolated, this tutorial uses a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial. This tutorial will also use a [phpMyAdmin](https://hub.docker.com/r/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/) deployment to connect and test MySQL database, once it is running. Run the following command to prepare your cluster for this tutorial:

```console
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace "demo" created

$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubedb/cli/0.8.0-rc.0/docs/examples/mysql/quickstart/demo-1.yaml
deployment "myadmin" created
service "myadmin" created

$ kubectl get pods -n demo --watch
NAME                      READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
myadmin-c4db4df95-8lk74   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          27s
myadmin-c4db4df95-8lk74   1/1       Running             0          1m

$ kubectl get service -n demo
NAME      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
myadmin   LoadBalancer   10.105.73.16   <pending>     80:30158/TCP   23m

$ minikube ip
192.168.99.100
```

Now, open your browser and go to the following URL: _http://{minikube-ip}:{myadmin-svc-nodeport}_.
You can also get this URl by running the following command:

```console
$ minikube service myadmin -n demo --url
http://192.168.99.100:30158
```

According to the above example, this URL will be [http://192.168.99.100:30158](http://192.168.99.100:30158). The login informations to phpMyAdmin _(host, username and password)_ will be retrieved later in this tutorial.

## Create a MySQL database

KubeDB implements a `MySQL` CRD to define the specification of a MySQL database. Below is the `MySQL` object created in this tutorial.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MySQL
metadata:
  name: mysql-quickstart
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "8.0"
  doNotPause: true
  storage:
    storageClassName: "standard"
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 50Mi
```

```console
$ kubedb create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubedb/cli/0.8.0-rc.0/docs/examples/mysql/quickstart/demo-2.yaml
mysql "mysql-quickstart" created
```

Here,

- `spec.version` is the version of MySQL database. In this tutorial, a MySQL 8.0 database is going to be created.
- `spec.doNotPause` tells KubeDB operator that if this object is deleted, it should be automatically reverted. This should be set to true for production databases to avoid accidental deletion.
- `spec.storage` specifies the StorageClass of PVC dynamically allocated to store data for this database. This storage spec will be passed to the StatefulSet created by KubeDB operator to run database pods. You can specify any StorageClass available in your cluster with appropriate resource requests. Since release 0.8.0-rc.0, a storage spec is required for MySQL.

KubeDB operator watches for `MySQL` objects using Kubernetes api. When a `MySQL` object is created, KubeDB operator will create a new StatefulSet and a ClusterIP Service with the matching MySQL object name. KubeDB operator will also create a governing service for StatefulSets with the name `kubedb`, if one is not already present. No MySQL specific RBAC permission is required in [RBAC enabled clusters](/docs/0.8.0-rc.0/setup/install#using-yaml).

```console

```

KubeDB operator sets the `status.phase` to `Running` once the database is successfully created. Run the following command to see the modified MySQL object:

```yaml
$ kubedb get my -n demo mysql-quickstart -o yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MySQL
metadata:
  clusterName: ""
  creationTimestamp: 2018-02-09T09:55:42Z
  finalizers:
  - kubedb.com
  generation: 0
  name: mysql-quickstart
  namespace: demo
  resourceVersion: "25645"
  selfLink: /apis/kubedb.com/v1alpha1/namespaces/demo/mysqls/mysql-quickstart
  uid: 64388c9a-0d7f-11e8-9091-08002751ae8c
spec:
  databaseSecret:
    secretName: mysql-quickstart-auth
  doNotPause: true
  storage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 50Mi
    storageClassName: standard
  version: 8
status:
  creationTime: 2018-02-09T09:55:43Z
  phase: Running
```

Please note that KubeDB operator has created a new Secret called `mysql-quickstart-auth` *(format: {mysql-object-name}-auth)* for storing the password for `mysql` superuser. This secret contains a `user` key which contains the *username* for MySQL superuser and a `password` key which contains the *password* for MySQL superuser.
If you want to use an existing secret please specify that when creating the MySQL object using `spec.databaseSecret.secretName`. While creating this secret manually, make sure the secret contains these two keys containing data `user` and `password` and also make sure of using `root` as value of `user`.

Now, you can connect to this database from the phpMyAdmin dashboard using the database pod IP and and `mysql` user password.

```console
$ kubectl get pods mysql-quickstart-0 -n demo -o yaml | grep IP
  hostIP: 192.168.99.100
  podIP: 172.17.0.6

$ kubectl get secrets -n demo mysql-quickstart-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\user}' | base64 -d
root

$ kubectl get secrets -n demo mysql-quickstart-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\password}' | base64 -d
pefjWeXoAQ9PaRZv
```

Now, open your browser and go to the following URL: _http://{minikube-ip}:{myadmin-svc-nodeport}_. To log into the phpMyAdmin, use host __`172.17.0.6`__ , username __`root`__ and password __`pefjWeXoAQ9PaRZv`__.

## Pause Database

KubeDB takes advantage of `ValidationWebhook` feature in Kubernetes 1.9.0 or later clusters to implement `doNotPause` feature. If admission webhook is enabled, It prevents user from deleting the database as long as the `spec.doNotPause` is set to true. Since the MySQL object created in this tutorial has `spec.doNotPause` set to true, if you delete the MySQL object, KubeDB operator will nullify the delete operation. You can see this below:

```console
$ kubedb delete my mysql-quickstart -n demo
error: MySQL "mysql-quickstart" can't be paused. To continue delete, unset spec.doNotPause and retry.
```

Now, run `kubedb edit my mysql-quickstart -n demo` to set `spec.doNotPause` to false or remove this field (which default to false). Then if you delete the MySQL object, KubeDB operator will delete the StatefulSet and its pods, but leaves the PVCs unchanged. In KubeDB parlance, we say that `mysql-quickstart` MySQL database has entered into dormant state. This is represented by KubeDB operator by creating a matching DormantDatabase object.

```console
$ kubedb delete my mysql-quickstart -n demo
mysql "mysql-quickstart" deleted

$ kubedb get drmn -n demo mysql-quickstart
NAME               STATUS    AGE
mysql-quickstart   Pausing   16s

$ kubedb get drmn -n demo mysql-quickstart
NAME               STATUS    AGE
mysql-quickstart   Paused    31s
```

```yaml
$ kubedb get drmn -n demo mysql-quickstart -o yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: DormantDatabase
metadata:
  clusterName: ""
  creationTimestamp: 2018-02-09T10:18:29Z
  finalizers:
  - kubedb.com
  generation: 0
  labels:
    kubedb.com/kind: MySQL
  name: mysql-quickstart
  namespace: demo
  resourceVersion: "26269"
  selfLink: /apis/kubedb.com/v1alpha1/namespaces/demo/dormantdatabases/mysql-quickstart
  uid: 931ce051-0d82-11e8-9091-08002751ae8c
spec:
  origin:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      name: mysql-quickstart
      namespace: demo
    spec:
      mysql:
        databaseSecret:
          secretName: mysql-quickstart-auth
        resources: {}
        storage:
          accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 50Mi
          storageClassName: standard
        version: "8"
status:
  creationTime: 2018-02-09T10:18:30Z
  pausingTime: 2018-02-09T10:18:48Z
  phase: Paused
```

Here,

- `spec.origin` is the spec of the original spec of the original MySQL object.
- `status.phase` points to the current database state `Paused`.

## Resume Dormant Database

To resume the database from the dormant state, create same `MySQL` object with same Spec.

In this tutorial, the dormant database can be resumed by creating original `MySQL` object.

The below command will resume the DormantDatabase `mysql-quickstart` that was created before.

```console
$ kubedb create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubedb/cli/0.8.0-rc.0/docs/examples/mysql/quickstart/demo-2.yaml
mysql "mysql-quickstart" created
```

## WipeOut DormantDatabase

You can wipe out a DormantDatabase while deleting the objet by setting `spec.wipeOut` to true. KubeDB operator will delete any relevant resources of this `MySQL` database (i.e, PVCs, Secrets, Snapshots). It will also delete snapshot data stored in the Cloud Storage buckets.

```yaml
$ kubedb delete my mysql-quickstart -n demo
mysql "mysql-quickstart" deleted

$ kubedb edit drmn -n demo mysql-quickstart
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: DormantDatabase
metadata:
  name: mysql-quickstart
  namespace: demo
  ...
spec:
  wipeOut: true
  ...
status:
  phase: Paused
  ...
```

If `spec.wipeOut` is not set to true while deleting the `dormantdatabase` object, then only this object will be deleted and `kubedb-operator` won't delete related Secrets, PVCs and Snapshots. So, user still can access the stored data in the cloud storage buckets as well as PVCs.

## Delete Dormant Database

As it is already discussed above, `DormantDatabase` can be deleted with or without wiping out the resources. To delete the `dormantdatabase`,

```console
$ kubedb delete drmn mysql-quickstart -n demo
dormantdatabase "mysql-quickstart" deleted
```

## Cleaning up

To cleanup the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:

```console
$ kubectl patch -n demo mysql/mysql-quickstart -p '{"spec":{"doNotPause":false}}' --type="merge"
$ kubectl delete -n demo mysql/mysql-quickstart

$ kubectl patch -n demo drmn/mysql-quickstart -p '{"spec":{"wipeOut":true}}' --type="merge"
$ kubectl delete -n demo drmn/mysql-quickstart

$ kubectl delete ns demo
namespace "demo" deleted
```
