# Elasticsearch

## What is Elasticsearch

`Elasticsearch` is a Kubernetes `Custom Resource Definitions` (CRD). It provides declarative configuration for [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) in a Kubernetes native way. You only need to describe the desired database configuration in a Elasticsearch object, and the KubeDB operator will create Kubernetes objects in the desired state for you.

## Elasticsearch Spec

As with all other Kubernetes objects, a Elasticsearch needs `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata` fields. It also needs a `.spec` section. Below is an example Elasticsearch object.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: e1
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: 5.6.4
  topology:
    master:
      replicas: 1
      prefix: master
    data:
      replicas: 2
      prefix: data
    client:
      replicas: 1
      prefix: client
  databaseSecret:
    secretName: e1-auth
  certificateSecret:
    secretName: e1-cert
  storage:
    storageClassName: "standard"
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 50Mi
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
  init:
    snapshotSource:
      name: "snapshot-xyz"
  backupSchedule:
    cronExpression: "@every 6h"
    storageSecretName: snap-secret
    gcs:
      bucket: restic
      prefix: demo
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
  monitor:
    agent: coreos-prometheus-operator
    prometheus:
      namespace: demo
      labels:
        app: kubedb
      interval: 10s
  doNotPause: true
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "64Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    limits:
      memory: "128Mi"
      cpu: "500m"
```

### spec.version

`spec.version` is a required field specifying the version of Elasticsearch cluster. Currently the supported value is `5.6.4`.


### spec.topology

`spec.topology` is an optional field that specify to the number of pods we want as dedicated nodes and also specify prefix for their StatefulSet name

- `spec.topology.master`
    - `.replicas` is an optional field to specify how many pods we want as `master` node. If not set, this defaults to 1.
    - `.prefix` is an optional field to be used as prefix of StatefulSet name.
- `spec.topology.data`
    - `.replicas` is an optional field to specify how many pods we want as `data` node. If not set, this defaults to 1.
    - `.prefix` is an optional field to be used as prefix of StatefulSet name.
- `spec.topology.client`
    - `.replicas` is an optional field to specify how many pods we want as `client` node. If not set, this defaults to 1.
    - `.prefix` is an optional field to be used as prefix of StatefulSet name.

> Note: Any two of them can't have same prefix.

#### spec.replicas

`spec.replicas` is an optional field that can be used if `spec.topology` is not specified. This field specifies the number of pods in the Elasticsearch cluster. If not set, this defaults to 1.


### spec.databaseSecret

`spec.databaseSecret` is an optional field that points to a Secret used to hold credential and [search guard](https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard) configuration.

  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD:` Password for `admin` user.
  - `READALL_PASSWORD:` Password for `readall` user.

Following keys are used for search-guard configuration

  - `sg_config.yml:` Configure authenticators and authorization backends
  - `sg_internal_users.yml:` user and hashed passwords (hash with hasher.sh)
  - `sg_roles_mapping.yml:` map backend roles, hosts and users to roles
  - `sg_action_groups.yml:` define permission groups
  - `sg_roles.yml:` define the roles and the associated permissions

If not set, KubeDB operator creates a new Secret `{Elasticsearch name}-auth` with generated credentials and default search-guard configuration. If you want to use an existing secret, please specify that when creating Elasticsearch using `spec.databaseSecret.secretName`.

### spec.certificateSecret

`spec.certificateSecret` is an optional field that points a Secret used to hold following information for certificate.

  - `root.pem:` The root CA in `pem` format
  - `root.jks:` The root CA in `jks` format
  - `node.jks:` The node certificate used for transport layer
  - `client.jks:` The client certificate used for http layer
  - `sgadmin.jks:` The admin certificate used to change the Search Guard configuration.
  - `key_pass:` The key password used to encrypt certificates.

If not set, KubeDB operator creates a new Secret `{Elasticsearch name}-cert` with generated certificates. If you want to use an existing secret, please specify that when creating Elasticsearch using `spec.certificateSecret.secretName`.

### spec.storage

`spec.storage` is an optional field that specifies the StorageClass of PVCs dynamically allocated to store data for the database. This storage spec will be passed to the StatefulSet created by KubeDB operator to run database pods. You can specify any StorageClass available in your cluster with appropriate resource requests. If no storage spec is given, an `emptyDir` is used.

 - `spec.storage.storageClassName` is the name of the StorageClass used to provision PVCs. PVCs donâ€™t necessarily have to request a class. A PVC with its storageClassName set equal to "" is always interpreted to be requesting a PV with no class, so it can only be bound to PVs with no class (no annotation or one set equal to ""). A PVC with no storageClassName is not quite the same and is treated differently by the cluster depending on whether the DefaultStorageClass admission plugin is turned on.
 - `spec.storage.accessModes` uses the same conventions as Kubernetes PVCs when requesting storage with specific access modes.
 - `spec.storage.resources` can be used to request specific quantities of storage. This follows the same resource model used by PVCs.

To learn how to configure `spec.storage`, please visit the links below:
 - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims


### spec.nodeSelector

`spec.nodeSelector` is an optional field that specifies a map of key-value pairs. For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the node must have each of the indicated key-value pairs as labels (it can have additional labels as well). To learn more, see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) .


### spec.init

`spec.init` is an optional section that can be used to initialize a newly created Elasticsearch cluster from prior snapshots. To initialize from prior snapshots, set the `spec.init.snapshotSource` section when creating a Elasticsearch object. In this case, SnapshotSource must have following information:

 - `name:` Name of the Snapshot

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch-db
spec:
  version: 2.3.1
  replicas: 1
  init:
    snapshotSource:
      name: "snapshot-xyz"
```

In the above example, Elasticsearch cluster will be initialized from Snapshot `snapshot-xyz` in `default` namespace. Here, KubeDB operator will launch a Job to initialize Elasticsearch, once StatefulSet pods are running.

### spec.backupSchedule

KubeDB supports taking periodic snapshots for Elasticsearch database. This is an optional section in `.spec`. When `spec.backupSchedule` section is added, KubeDB operator immediately takes a backup to validate this information. After that, at each tick kubeDB operator creates a [Snapshot](/docs/0.8.0-rc.0/concepts/snapshot) object. This triggers operator to create a Job to take backup. If used, set the various sub-fields accordingly.

 - `spec.backupSchedule.cronExpression` is a required [cron expression](https://github.com/robfig/cron/blob/v2/doc.go#L26). This specifies the schedule for backup operations.
 - `spec.backupSchedule.{storage}` is a required field that is used as the destination for storing snapshot data. KubeDB supports cloud storage providers like S3, GCS, Azure and OpenStack Swift. It also supports any locally mounted Kubernetes volumes, like NFS, Ceph , etc. Only one backend can be used at a time. To learn how to configure this, please visit [here](/docs/0.8.0-rc.0/concepts/snapshot).
 - `spec.backupSchedule.resources` is an optional field that can request compute resources required by Jobs used to take snapshot or initialize databases from snapshot.  To learn more, visit [here](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/compute-resources/).


### spec.doNotPause

`spec.doNotPause` is an optional field that tells KubeDB operator that if this Elasticsearch object is deleted, whether it should be reverted automatically. This should be set to `true` for production databases to avoid accidental deletion. If not set or set to false, deleting a Elasticsearch object put the database into a dormant state. THe StatefulSet for a DormantDatabase is deleted but the underlying PVCs are left intact. This allows user to resume the database later.


### spec.monitor

Elasticsearch managed by KubeDB can be monitored with builtin-Prometheus and CoreOS-Prometheus operator out-of-the-box. To learn more,

- [Monitor Elasticsearch with builtin Prometheus](/docs/0.8.0-rc.0/guides/elasticsearch/monitoring/using-builtin-prometheus)
- [Monitor Elasticsearch with CoreOS Prometheus operator](/docs/0.8.0-rc.0/guides/elasticsearch/monitoring/using-coreos-prometheus-operator)


### spec.resources

`spec.resources` is an optional field. This can be used to request compute resources required by the database pods. To learn more, visit [here](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/compute-resources/).
