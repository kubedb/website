# AppBinding

## What is AppBinding

An `AppBinding` is a Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition`(CRD) which points to an application using either its URL (usually for a non-Kubernetes resident service instance) or a Kubernetes service object (if self-hosted in a Kubernetes cluster), some optional parameters and a credential secret. To learn more about AppBinding and the problems it solves, please read this blog post: [The case for AppBinding](https://appscode.com/blog/post/the-case-for-appbinding).

If you deploy a database using [KubeDB](https://kubedb.com/docs/latest/welcome/), `AppBinding` object will be created automatically for it. Otherwise, you have to create an `AppBinding` object manually pointing to your desired database.

KubeDB uses [Stash](https://appscode.com/products/stash/) to perform backup/recovery of databases. Stash needs to know how to connect with a target database and the credentials necessary to access it. This is done via an `AppBinding`.

## AppBinding CRD Specification

Like any official Kubernetes resource, an `AppBinding` has `TypeMeta`, `ObjectMeta` and `Spec` sections. However, unlike other Kubernetes resources, it does not have a `Status` section.

An `AppBinding` object created by `KubeDB` for PostgreSQL database is shown below,

```yaml
apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: AppBinding
metadata:
  name: quick-postgres
  namespace: demo
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: database
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: quick-postgres
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kubedb.com
    app.kubernetes.io/name: postgres
    app.kubernetes.io/version: "10.2"
    app.kubernetes.io/name: postgreses.kubedb.com
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: quick-postgres
spec:
  type: kubedb.com/postgres
  secret:
    name: quick-postgres-auth
  clientConfig:
    service:
      name: quick-postgres
      path: /
      port: 5432
      query: sslmode=disable
      scheme: postgresql
  secretTransforms:
    - renameKey:
        from: POSTGRES_USER
        to: username
    - renameKey:
        from: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
        to: password
  version: "10.2"
```

Here, we are going to describe the sections of an `AppBinding` crd.

### AppBinding `Spec`

An `AppBinding` object has the following fields in the `spec` section:

#### spec.type

`spec.type` is an optional field that indicates the type of the app that this `AppBinding` is pointing to. Stash uses this field to resolve the values of `TARGET_APP_TYPE`, `TARGET_APP_GROUP` and `TARGET_APP_RESOURCE` variables of [BackupBlueprint](https://appscode.com/products/stash/latest/concepts/crds/backupblueprint/) object.

This field follows the following format: `<app group>/<resource kind>`. The above AppBinding is pointing to a `postgres` resource under `kubedb.com` group.

Here, the variables are parsed as follows:

|       Variable        |                                                               Usage                                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TARGET_APP_GROUP`    | Represents the application group where the respective app belongs (i.e: `kubedb.com`).                                            |
| `TARGET_APP_RESOURCE` | Represents the resource under that application group that this appbinding represents (i.e: `postgres`).                           |
| `TARGET_APP_TYPE`     | Represents the complete type of the application. It's simply `TARGET_APP_GROUP/TARGET_APP_RESOURCE` (i.e: `kubedb.com/postgres`). |

#### spec.secret

`spec.secret` specifies the name of the secret which contains the credentials that are required to access the database. This secret must be in the same namespace as the `AppBinding`.

This secret must contain the following keys:

PostgreSQL :

| Key                 | Usage                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `POSTGRES_USER`     | Username of the target database.                    |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Password for the user specified by `POSTGRES_USER`. |

MySQL :

| Key        | Usage                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `username` | Username of the target database.               |
| `password` | Password for the user specified by `username`. |

MongoDB :

| Key        | Usage                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `username` | Username of the target database.               |
| `password` | Password for the user specified by `username`. |

Elasticsearch:

|       Key        |          Usage          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | Admin username          |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password for admin user |

#### spec.clientConfig

`spec.clientConfig` defines how to communicate with the target database. You can use either an URL or a Kubernetes service to connect with the database. You don't have to specify both of them.

You can configure following fields in `spec.clientConfig` section:

- **spec.clientConfig.url**

  `spec.clientConfig.url` gives the location of the database, in standard URL form (i.e. `[scheme://]host:port/[path]`). This is particularly useful when the target database is running outside of the Kubernetes cluster. If your database is running inside the cluster, use `spec.clientConfig.service` section instead.

  > Note that, attempting to use a user or basic auth (e.g. `user:password@host:port`) is not allowed. Stash will insert them automatically from the respective secret. Fragments ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not allowed either.

- **spec.clientConfig.service**

  If you are running the database inside the Kubernetes cluster, you can use Kubernetes service to connect with the database. You have to specify the following fields in `spec.clientConfig.service` section if you manually create an `AppBinding` object.

  - **name :** `name` indicates the name of the service that connects with the target database.
  - **scheme :** `scheme` specifies the scheme (i.e. http, https) to use to connect with the database.
  - **port :** `port` specifies the port where the target database is running.

- **spec.clientConfig.insecureSkipTLSVerify**

  `spec.clientConfig.insecureSkipTLSVerify` is used to disable TLS certificate verification while connecting with the database. We strongly discourage to disable TLS verification during backup. You should provide the respective CA bundle through `spec.clientConfig.caBundle` field instead.

- **spec.clientConfig.caBundle**

  `spec.clientConfig.caBundle` is a PEM encoded CA bundle which will be used to validate the serving certificate of the database.
