Integrating OpenSearch within a Kubernetes environment offers a powerful combination that brings a host of advantages. It allows for the seamless management of OpenSearch clusters at scale, ensuring optimal resource utilization and high availability, all within the robust orchestration framework of Kubernetes. Kubernetes simplifies the deployment and scaling of OpenSearch instances, making it easier to adapt to evolving data demands. Additionally, it provides a unified platform for handling both application and data infrastructure, streamlining operations and reducing complexity. This integration enhances the overall efficiency and resilience of OpenSearch deployments, facilitating real-time data processing and search capabilities within Kubernetes clusters, making it a formidable solution for modern data-driven applications.

## Deploying OpenSearch on Kubernetes
### Pre-requisites
We have to set up the environment to deploy OpenSearch on Kubernetes using a Kubernetes OpenSearch operator. A running Kubernetes cluster and a fundamental understanding of OpenSearch are required to conduct this tutorial. Here, we are going to create our kubernetes cluster using [Kind](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kind). Additionally, you need to install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to your Kubernetes cluster.

In this article, We will use the Kubernetes OpenSearch operator [KubeDB](https://kubedb.com/) to deploy OpenSearch on Kubernetes. We must have KubeDB installed in our Kubernetes cluster. KubeDB provides supports for the official Elasticsearch by [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) and [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) by AWS, but also other open source distributions like [SearchGuard](https://search-guard.com/) and [OpenDistro](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/). **KubeDB provides all of these distributionâ€™s support under the Elasticsearch CR of KubeDB**. To set up KubeDB in our Kubernetes cluster, we require a license. Through the [Appscode License Server](https://license-issuer.appscode.com/), we can get a free enterprise license. We must provide our Kubernetes cluster ID to obtain a license. Run the following command below to get the cluster ID.
 
```bash
$ kubectl get ns kube-system -o jsonpath='{.metadata.uid}'
6c08dcb8-8440-4388-849f-1f2b590b731e
```

The license server will email us with a "license.txt" file attached after we provide the necessary data. Run the following commands listed below to install KubeDB. 

```bash
$ helm install kubedb oci://ghcr.io/appscode-charts/kubedb \
  --version v2023.12.11 \
  --namespace kubedb --create-namespace \
  --set-file global.license=/path/to/the/license.txt \
  --wait --burst-limit=10000 --debug
```

Verify the installation by the following command,

```bash
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=kubedb"
NAMESPACE   NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kubedb      kubedb-kubedb-autoscaler-8685b5f5f8-kwh9r       1/1     Running   0          2m38s
kubedb      kubedb-kubedb-dashboard-677448dff8-ggrz6        1/1     Running   0          2m38s
kubedb      kubedb-kubedb-ops-manager-f4d869f54-xbtd7       1/1     Running   0          2m38s
kubedb      kubedb-kubedb-provisioner-778795d79-zbn74       1/1     Running   0          2m38s
kubedb      kubedb-kubedb-schema-manager-64f9cc9445-vwfsk   1/1     Running   0          2m38s
kubedb      kubedb-kubedb-webhook-server-85cb5f5fdb-jtpgt   1/1     Running   0          2m38s
``` 
We can go on to the next stage if every pod status is running.

## Create a Namespace
Now we'll create a new namespace in which we will deploy OpenSearch. To create a namespace, we can use the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl create namespace os-demo
namespace/os-demo created
``` 

## Deploy OpenSearch via Kubernetes OpenSearch operator
We need to create a yaml configuration to deploy OpenSearch on Kubernetes. And we will apply this yaml below,

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: os-cluster
  namespace: os-demo
spec:
  enableSSL: true 
  version: opensearch-2.11.1
  storageType: Durable
  topology:
    master:
      replicas: 2
      resources:
      storage:
        storageClassName: "standard"
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
    data:
      replicas: 2
      resources:
      storage:
        storageClassName: "standard"
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
    ingest:
      replicas: 2
      resources:
      storage:
        storageClassName: "standard"
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
  terminationPolicy: WipeOut
```

You can see the detailed yaml specifications in the [Kubernetes OpenSearch](https://kubedb.com/docs/latest/guides/elasticsearch/quickstart/overview/opensearch/) documentation.

We will save this yaml configuration to `os-cluster.yaml`. Then create the above OpenSearch object.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f os-cluster.yaml
elasticsearch.kubedb.com/os-cluster created
```

If all the above steps are handled correctly and the OpenSearch is deployed, you will see that the following objects are created:


```bash
$ kubectl get all -n os-demo
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/os-cluster-data-0     1/1     Running   0          4m37s
pod/os-cluster-data-1     1/1     Running   0          2m39s
pod/os-cluster-ingest-0   1/1     Running   0          4m47s
pod/os-cluster-ingest-1   1/1     Running   0          2m42s
pod/os-cluster-master-0   1/1     Running   0          4m42s
pod/os-cluster-master-1   1/1     Running   0          2m36s

NAME                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/os-cluster          ClusterIP   10.96.99.212   <none>        9200/TCP   4m55s
service/os-cluster-master   ClusterIP   None           <none>        9300/TCP   4m55s
service/os-cluster-pods     ClusterIP   None           <none>        9200/TCP   4m55s

NAME                                 READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/os-cluster-data     2/2     4m37s
statefulset.apps/os-cluster-ingest   2/2     4m47s
statefulset.apps/os-cluster-master   2/2     4m42s

NAME                                            TYPE                       VERSION   AGE
appbinding.appcatalog.appscode.com/os-cluster   kubedb.com/elasticsearch   2.8.0     4m37s

NAME                                  VERSION            STATUS   AGE
elasticsearch.kubedb.com/os-cluster   opensearch-2.11.1   Ready    4m55s
```

We have successfully deployed OpenSearch to Kubernetes via the Kubernetes OpenSearch operator. Now, we will connect to the OpenSearch database to insert some sample data and verify whether our OpenSearch is usable or not. First, check the database status,

```bash
$ kubectl get es -n os-demo os-cluster
NAME         VERSION            STATUS   AGE
os-cluster   opensearch-2.11.1   Ready    4m59s
```
## Insert sample data to the OpenSearch database

Now, we will create few indexes in OpenSearch. The Kubernetes OpenSearch operator establishes a governing service with the name of the OpenSearch object itself when OpenSearch yaml is deployed. Using this service, we will port-forward to the database from our local workstation and establish a connection. After that, we'll add some data to OpenSearch.

## Port-forward the Service
KubeDB will create few Services to connect with the database. Letâ€™s see the Services created by KubeDB for our OpenSearch,

```bash
$ kubectl get service -n os-demo -l=app.kubernetes.io/instance=os-cluster
NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
os-cluster          ClusterIP   10.96.220.157   <none>        9200/TCP   5m
os-cluster-master   ClusterIP   None            <none>        9300/TCP   5m
os-cluster-pods     ClusterIP   None            <none>        9200/TCP   5m
```
Here, we are going to use the `os-cluster` Service to connect with the database. Now, letâ€™s port-forward the `os-cluster` Service.

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward -n os-demo svc/os-cluster 9200
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9200 -> 9200
Forwarding from [::1]:9200 -> 9200
``` 
## Export the Credentials
Kubernetes OpenSearch operator will create some Secrets for the database. Letâ€™s list the Secrets for our `os-cluster`.

```bash
$ kubectl get secret -n os-demo -l=app.kubernetes.io/instance=os-cluster
NAME                              TYPE                       DATA   AGE
os-cluster-admin-cert             kubernetes.io/tls          3      5m
os-cluster-admin-cred             kubernetes.io/basic-auth   2      5m
os-cluster-ca-cert                kubernetes.io/tls          2      5m
os-cluster-client-cert            kubernetes.io/tls          3      5m
os-cluster-config                 Opaque                     3      5m
os-cluster-http-cert              kubernetes.io/tls          3      5m
os-cluster-kibanaro-cred          kubernetes.io/basic-auth   2      5m
os-cluster-kibanaserver-cred      kubernetes.io/basic-auth   2      5m
os-cluster-logstash-cred          kubernetes.io/basic-auth   2      5m
os-cluster-readall-cred           kubernetes.io/basic-auth   2      5m
os-cluster-snapshotrestore-cred   kubernetes.io/basic-auth   2      5m
os-cluster-transport-cert         kubernetes.io/tls          3      5m
```
Now, we can connect to the database with any of these secret that have the prefix `cred`. Here, we will use `os-cluster-admin-cred` which contains the admin level credentials to connect with the database.

```bash
$ kubectl get secret -n os-demo os-cluster-admin-cred -o jsonpath='{.data.username}' | base64 -d
admin
$ kubectl get secret -n os-demo os-cluster-admin-cred -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
t;gmkX(o!4DuU6XP
```
We will now use curl to post some sample data into OpenSearch. Use the -k flag to disable attempts to verify self-signed certificates for testing purposes.

```bash
$ curl -XPOST -k --user 'admin:t;gmkX(o!4DuU6XP' "https://localhost:9200/music/_doc?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
                           {
                               "Artist": "Backstreet Boys",
                               "Song": "Show Me The Meaning"
                           }
                           '
{
  "_index" : "music",
  "_id" : "MRIPuYsBGygDWO9F_G9o",
  "_version" : 1,
  "result" : "created",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 2,
    "successful" : 2,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 0,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}
```
Now, letâ€™s verify that the index has been created successfully.

```bash
$ curl -XGET -k --user 'admin:t;gmkX(o!4DuU6XP' "https://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v&s=index&pretty"
health status index                        uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size

```
Also, letâ€™s verify the data in the indexes:

```bash
$ curl -XGET -k --user 'admin:t;gmkX(o!4DuU6XP' "https://localhost:9200/music/_search?pretty"
{
  "took" : 93,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "music",
        "_id" : "MRIPuYsBGygDWO9F_G9o",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "Artist" : "Backstreet Boys",
          "Song" : "Show Me The Meaning"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Weâ€™ve successfully Deploy OpenSearch to Kubernetes via **Kubernetes OpenSearch Operator** KubeDB and insert some sample data into it.
